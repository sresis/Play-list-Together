## About Me

Stephanie's interest in computer science was sparked during her last semester at the University of Michigan. Stephanie had completed an finance internship at Intel the previous summer and had accepted her offer to work as a finance analyst at Intel upon graduating. Stephanie took an introductory CS class and was excited that she found a new field that she was passionate about and did well at.

While working in finance for the past 5 years, Stephanie particularly building out the logic of financial models. When COVID-19 started, she had more free time to explore programming classes online. This helped her to re-realize her passion for computer science Â -- particularly building things and solving problems.
